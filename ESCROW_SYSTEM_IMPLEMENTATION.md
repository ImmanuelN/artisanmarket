# Artisan Market - Escrow & Delivery Proof System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of an escrow-based payment system with delivery proof requirements for the Artisan Market platform.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Escrow Payment System
- **Purpose**: Holds customer payments until order delivery is confirmed
- **Flow**: Payment → Escrow (held) → Delivery Proof → Release to Vendor
- **Database Fields**:
  - `escrowStatus`: 'held', 'released', 'refunded'
  - `escrowAmount`: Total amount held in escrow
  - `escrowReleaseDate`: When funds were released

### 2. Arrival Proof Upload (Processing Center)
- **Required for**: Orders with status 'pending'
- **Process**: Vendor uploads photo evidence of items arriving at processing center
- **Features**:
  - Image upload via ImageKit
  - Optional arrival notes and processing location
  - Automatic order status change from 'pending' to 'processing'
  - 15-minute re-upload window after initial upload
  - Admin verification required for approval

### 3. Vendor Balance Management
- **Pending Balance**: Shows money from orders awaiting delivery
- **Available Balance**: Released funds ready for payout
- **Auto-calculation**: Updates based on order status changes

### 4. Admin Panel Features
- **Order Management**: Full control over order status changes
- **Delivery Proof Review**: Approve/reject/require review
- **Escrow Control**: Manual release capabilities
- **Dashboard**: Overview of system metrics

### 5. Vendor Restrictions
- **Status Changes**: Vendors cannot change order status directly
- **Delivery Process**: Must upload proof to mark as delivered
- **Balance Transparency**: Clear view of pending vs available funds

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Models

#### Order Model Updates
```javascript
escrowStatus: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['held', 'released', 'refunded'],
  default: 'held'
},
escrowAmount: {
  type: Number,
  required: true,
  min: 0
},
deliveryProof: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'DeliveryProof'
}
```

#### New DeliveryProof Model
```javascript
{
  order: ObjectId,
  vendor: ObjectId,
  imageUrl: String,
  imageId: String,
  uploadedAt: Date,
  deliveryNotes: String,
  verificationStatus: 'pending'|'approved'|'rejected'
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Vendor Routes
- `POST /vendor/orders/:orderId/delivery-proof` - Upload delivery proof
- `GET /vendor/delivery-proofs` - Get vendor's delivery proofs
- `GET /vendor/orders` - Get vendor orders with escrow info

#### Admin Routes
- `GET /admin/orders` - Get all orders with filters
- `PATCH /admin/orders/:orderId/status` - Update order status
- `GET /admin/delivery-proofs` - Get proofs for review
- `PATCH /admin/delivery-proofs/:proofId/review` - Review delivery proof
- `POST /admin/orders/:orderId/release-escrow` - Manual escrow release

### Frontend Features

#### Vendor Dashboard Updates
1. **Recent Orders Button**: Now navigates to orders tab instead of separate page
2. **Order Status Display**: Read-only for vendors
3. **Delivery Proof Upload**: Modal with image upload and form
4. **Escrow Status**: Visual indicators for held/released funds
5. **Balance Breakdown**: Pending vs available balance display

#### New UI Components
- Delivery proof upload modal
- Escrow status badges
- Admin notice about status restrictions
- Image preview and upload progress

## User Flows

### Vendor Arrival Process (Processing Center)
1. Order created with 'pending' status
2. Vendor sees "Upload Arrival Proof" button for pending orders
3. Vendor uploads photo of items arriving at processing center
4. Order automatically moved to 'processing' status
5. 15-minute window to re-upload if needed
6. Admin reviews arrival proof and approves/rejects
7. Approved proofs move order to 'shipped' status
8. Final delivery handled by processing/warehouse team

### Admin Review Process
1. New arrival proofs appear in admin panel
2. Admin reviews photo and verifies items reached processing center
3. Admin can approve, reject, or request more info
4. Approved proofs move order from 'processing' to 'shipped'
5. Rejected proofs revert order back to 'pending'
6. Processing team handles final delivery to customers

### Customer Experience
1. Payment held in escrow upon order creation
2. Tracking updates from vendor/admin
3. Delivery confirmation via proof system
4. Automatic fund release upon proof approval
